<h1> Foodie's time! What local food should you try in New Zealand?</h1>
<h3> If you think that Kiwiland only has the typical "western food", you might want to stop by and take a look at this list of underrated local delicacies.</h3>

<p> Hey Asian foodies! What food would you go for when you are hungry but you are in the city center with different options of meals (cafes, asian cuisine, burgers, fish and chips, mexican, restaurants, fast foods etc) available around you? Well, while you might just opt for what you feel like having at the moment or the nearest food you can reach, we Asians would usually ask Mr.Google for the "best food in town/near me"(you know, just to get the best out of the whole travelling experience so that they worth the travel money). Now you got a recommendation from Google and you have walked into a cafe, are you really sure of what kind of special food to order? While there are numerous western cafes back in our countries, pancakes, omelettes, waffles, sandwiches are the common sights in the menu.</p>
